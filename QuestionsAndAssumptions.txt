1.	Create a document/text file with a list of possible assumptions that you would make based on the Feature Criteria Requested
- These endpoints are used to display list of users that has coverage at some point in time
- Endpoints only pin-point to:
-- general list of data
-- filter by id
-- filter by state
-- filter by vehicle make
-- filter by former insurance
- any filtering request that does not exist in json will return an empty response


2.	Note any questions you would surface to the ScrumMaster/PM or Business Stakeholders/Product Owners regarding the feature request(s)
- Should there be an endpoint to search by consumers name - this feature can make searching easier if id isn't known
- What other information is useful upfront for the consumer
